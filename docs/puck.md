# Puck

> ## Info
> 
> The puck is a Unity game object that is controlled by the [Puck Script](https://github.com/NoahRobichaux/Robichaux_Breakout/blob/master/Assets/Scripts/Puck.cs).
> 
> At the start of Level One being loaded, the puck is frozen and the gravity scale of the puck is set to zero. 
> Then, if the player presses the spacebar, the game starts and the puck goes up in a random x direction (between -10f and 10f, where f declares that it is float). 
> 
> Once the puck comes in contact with a bar, the bar is destroyed, a sound effect is played and the puck is sent downward in a random x direction (between -10f and 10f).
