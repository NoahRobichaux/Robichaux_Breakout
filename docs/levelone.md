# Level One

> ## Info
> 
> Level One is a Unity scene with it's components written in Unity and C# (located in [*LevelOne.unity*](https://github.com/NoahRobichaux/Robichaux_Breakout/blob/master/Assets/Scenes/LevelOne.unity)).
> 
> This scene is where the majority of the game takes place. Some of the main components include the Player, the Puck, and the Bricks. 
>
> The scene also has a pause menu, which can be activated by pressing the escape key or by clicking the pause button graphic. Once triggered, the game's timescale is set to zero and the pause menu appears with a window and three unique buttons within said window. The first button from the top is the resume button, which deactivates the pause menu and sets the timescale back to one. The middle button is the restart button, which reloads the scene and restarts the level. The bottom button is the level select button, which loads the level select scene (located in [*LevelSelect.unity*](https://github.com/NoahRobichaux/Robichaux_Breakout/blob/master/Assets/Scenes/LevelSelect.unity)).
