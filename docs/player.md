# Player Controller

>
> ## Info
> 
> The [_Player Controller_](https://github.com/NoahRobichaux/Robichaux_Breakout/blob/master/Assets/Scripts/PlayerController.cs) is a script that controls the player's movement along the x axis. 
> 
> When the [_Level One Scene_](https://github.com/NoahRobichaux/Robichaux_Breakout/blob/master/Assets/Scenes/LevelOne.unity) is loaded, the script is active and in use. The player can be moved left and right with the keys A and D. The player's movement speed (float) is initially set to 1f in the script. This can be changed in the editor under the Speed input in the Player Controller Script component of the Player Bar object.

> As of Commit [_#143_](https://github.com/NoahRobichaux/Robichaux_Breakout/commit/5e500a66bb73125792734063a05d0334e6a4b3df), the player controls a bit different. When either of the A or D keys are released, the bar is frozen in place. This was changed to improve the gameplay experience. Previously, when the either of the control keys were released, the bar would remain in motion until it hit one of the invisible side walls.
