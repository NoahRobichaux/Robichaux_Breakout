# Player Controller

>
> ## Info
> 
> The [_Player Controller_](https://github.com/NoahRobichaux/Robichaux_Breakout/blob/master/Assets/Scripts/PlayerController.cs) is a script that controls the player's movement along the x axis. 
> 
> When level one is loaded, the script is active and in use. The player can be moved left and right with the keys A and D, respectively. The player's movement speed (float) is initially set to 1f in the script. This can be changed in the editor under the Speed input in the Player Controller Script component of the Player Bar object.
